1.Emulate Typing for 10fastfinger-1.7.user.js
a Script which enters the Text that is needed for the WPM Test automatically into the Input box.
(It is currently broken i did a quick and dirty solution by tricking the event system.)
( Currently it doesnt recognize typing by this script so what i did is that you have to manually press the Spacebar through that you can still trick the website into
thinking a human is writing but it is also not automatically anymore and needs user input)

2.JustWatch Search Button for Aniworld.to and s.to-1.7.user.js
Not Proud about this one but it works. it basically creates 2 new buttons to every title on the justwatch search these buttons search the title on specific sites in
this case it is aniworld.to and s.to you can easily modify it for any site.

3.Redirect Via Keywords-1.1.user.js
This is basically a Script solution to what Ecosia does. It simply redirects you to certain websites based on specific keywords that you can enter it also allows you
to directly search on the website by writing what you want to search after the keyword.
Works pretty good and is easy to modify for any keyword you need by adding new keywords and websites to the Object at the beginning of the Script
